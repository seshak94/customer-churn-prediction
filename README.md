# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a neural network to predict customer churn using telecom data. The model classifies whether a customer is likely to leave based on features such as tenure, charges, and service usage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Compared multiple neural network architectures (with/without dropout)
- Achieved up to 75.6% validation accuracy
- Visualized churn distribution using pie and bar charts
- Plotted training vs validation accuracy to detect overfitting

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas keras matplotlib

2. Run the notebook or script file.

3. Modify the data path if necessary.
